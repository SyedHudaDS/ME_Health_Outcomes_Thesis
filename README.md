Impact of Socio-economic Factors on Health Outcomes & Quality Performance in Underserved Communities of America: Maine

Research Question: 


Relationship between Socio-economic factors and health outcomes in rural Maine?
Relationship between Socio-economic factors and county health delivery performance?
Any specific population at higher risk to economic factors?  



Introduction:

Federal Qualified Health Centers (FQHC’s) are primary healthcare providers which offer medical services to millions of underserved communities, rural areas, low-income families, and uninsured population in America. For some communities it’s the only access to healthcare. These communities, which are often regarded as the underbelly of America, are the most vulnerable to socioeconomic conditions. This study reviews the data provided by FQHCs through HRSA (Health Resources and Services Administration) to analyze the impact of socioeconomic factors on health outcomes and quality performance across different counties of Maine. This model can be further implemented to all U.S counties to provide accurate predictions of health outcomes, better address the health disparities and improve healthcare access for underprivileged communities.
