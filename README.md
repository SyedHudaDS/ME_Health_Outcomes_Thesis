Research Question: 


Can Socio-economic Factors impact Health Outcomes in Maine? ​


What are the impact of these factors on Healthcare Performance & delivery in different counties in US?



Introduction:


Federal Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are community-based healthcare providers that offer comprehensive primary care services to underserved populations, including low-income individuals, uninsured individuals, and those living in rural or medically underserved areas for e.g rural Maine. These health centers are an essential component of the healthcare safety net in the United States, providing access to quality care for millions of Americans who might otherwise go without.

Analyzing data from FQHCs is critical for understanding the health outcomes of underserved populations and identifying areas for improvement in healthcare delivery.  FQHCs are required to collect and report data on patient demographics, clinical services, and health outcomes to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). This data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of FQHCs in improving access to care, reducing health disparities, and addressing the social determinants of health that contribute to poor health outcomes. FQHC data can also be used to monitor population health trends, track progress towards national health goals, and inform healthcare policy decisions. 

Socio-economic factors have a significant impact on health outcomes in Maine and across different counties in the US, affecting healthcare performance and delivery. Understanding the complex interplay between socio-economic factors and healthcare outcomes is critical for addressing health disparities and improving healthcare access and delivery for underserved populations.

In Maine, socio-economic factors such as income, education, and employment status might be a strong predictors of health outcomes, with individuals living in poverty or with lower levels of education experiencing poorer health outcomes. These disparities are further compounded by factors such as geographic location, race, and ethnicity, highlighting the need for targeted interventions that address the social determinants of health.

The impact of socio-economic factors on healthcare performance and delivery varies across different counties in the US, with rural and medically underserved areas often experiencing significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare services. These areas may have a shortage of healthcare providers, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and limited resources for addressing the social determinants of health.
